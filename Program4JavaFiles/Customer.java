    You MUST implement one constructor, which increments numCustomer by 1 each
    time an instance of Customer is created. And you must implement
    getTimeStamp() method and
    public class Customer  {
   private static int numCustomer = 0;
   private int customerNo;
   private int timeStamp;
   public Customer(int time)    {       ...    }

   public String toString()    {       ...    } }
